# Signal Plan Checker — v1.0.4

- Fresh, clean build fixing the 1.0.3 boot error.
- Default seed: **60s** cycle, offset **0**, stages/intergreens **(15/5, 15/5, 15/5)** for A–D.
- Horizon: defaults to **max(cycle)+20s**, re-renders on blur/change.
- Plot button now validates and always renders.
- Live “Total used” below each junction (updates on every change).
