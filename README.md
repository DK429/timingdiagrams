# 2‑Junction Signals Explorer (static, no-server)

Updates:
- Stage bars are **green** with labels **inside** each stage band.
- **Coordination check**: pick an origin junction and stage, then the app draws **front (start)** and **back (end)** lines to the destination to show where that traffic arrives. The arrival window at the destination is highlighted.

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter stages + intergreens for A and B. Make sure the sum equals the cycle for each junction.
3. Set A→B and B→A travel times.
4. Click **Plot diagram**.
5. For coordination, choose **From** junction and **Stage**, then click **Check**. Two dashed lines show the front/back mapping; the destination arrival window is highlighted.

Everything is static and runs offline.
