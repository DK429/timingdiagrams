# Signals Explorer v3 â€” Arrows + Custom Overlays

- Directional **arrowheads** on overlay lines.
- **Custom overlays**: user specifies origin junction and absolute times (start/end in seconds) to a destination junction.
- **Skip/Clip** overrun handling for overlays.
- Overlays **repeat** for each stage occurrence (stage-based overlays).
- Interval overlays are **shaded** (~15% opacity) per hop, and the destination row shows an arrival window.
- Stage bands in **green**, labelled inside; intergreens in grey.
- **5s ticks** around stage bands; **10s light grid** between junctions.
- **Print Preview** window: exact paper sizes (A4/A3/Letter/Legal), true portrait/landscape, auto-fit + manual scale.
