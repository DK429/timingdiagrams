# Signal Plan Checker

**Version:** v1.0.25 (overlay wrap + print preview)  
**Runtime:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS â€” no server required.

## New in v1.0.25
- **Overlay wrap fix:** Splits interval overlays exactly at the horizon boundaries so polygons/arrival bands render cleanly across 0s and H. Point overlays remain single events.
- **Print to PDF (new tab):** Opens a clean preview window sized to your chosen paper (A4/A3) and orientation (landscape/portrait), then triggers the browser print dialog.
