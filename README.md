# Signal Plan Checker

**Version:** v1.0.24.6 (wrapfix)  
**Runtime:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS â€” no server required.

This patch fixes whole-stage overlays that wrapped at the horizon:
- No more reversed (backwards) overlay lines on later repeats.
- Shaded destination band is correctly split across the wrap.

See PROMPT.md (spec), BUGS.md (issues), CHANGELOG.md (what changed).
