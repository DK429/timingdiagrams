# Signals Explorer v3 — repeat + shaded intervals

- Overlays now **repeat for every occurrence** of the chosen stage across the horizon.
- For **Interval (whole stage)** overlays, the area between the front/back lines is **shaded per hop** (≈15% opacity).
- Still includes: channels (shared A–B, B–C, C–D), diagonal lines, 5‑s ticks around junction bands, per‑overlay opacity, and TD save/load.

Open `index.html` (no server). Adjust journeys, cycles, stages in the Data tab; add overlays in Plot tab.
