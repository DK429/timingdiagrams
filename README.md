# Signal Plan Checker

**Version:** v1.0.24.2 (overlay point-mode fix)  
**Runtime:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no server required.

### What's fixed
- **Add Overlay → Mode: Point / Point (end)** now draws a **single arrival line** to the destination (no full-stage band). Interval (whole stage) continues to draw the sloped front/back lines, polygon, and shaded band at the destination.

All other functionality matches v1.0.24.1.
