# Signals Explorer v3p (channels + TD)

- All junctions (A–D) plotted together; thin green stages, grey intergreens.
- **Channels** between adjacent rows hold **both directions** for that pair. Lines drawn **diagonally**; 10‑s grid inside channels.
- **Multiple overlays** (point or interval), with per‑overlay **opacity** and arrival window highlight on destination row.
- **TD Save/Load**: one file holding junctions, journeys, row order, horizon and overlays.
- Standard JSON export/import still available.

## Demo seed
- A..D added by default.
- Journeys: A↔B, B↔C, C↔D seeded (edit in matrix).
- Four sample overlays show A→B, B→A, C→B, D→C.
