# Signals Explorer v3p (channels + TD) — v2

**New**
- Overlay mode **Point (stage end)**.
- **5‑second black tick markers** above and below each junction band.
- **Auto horizon** defaults to **3 × (max cycle)** and updates when cycles change or when you add/remove junctions.

**Still here**
- Channels between adjacent rows with 10‑s grids and diagonal journey lines (both directions in the same channel).
- Multi‑overlays with opacity slider (and live adjustments in the legend).
- Single‑file **TD save/load** (junctions, journeys, row order, horizon, overlays). Also keeps JSON export/import.
