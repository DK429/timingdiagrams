# Known Issues â€” v1.0.24.6

- Stage bars themselves are still rendered with a simple tile (no bar-level wrap split). Visually OK but a later pass will unify the technique.
- Point overlays still lack arrival markers/ticks.
- Print/preview scaling out of scope for this hotfix.
- Clipboard on iPadOS may fall back to SVG text.
